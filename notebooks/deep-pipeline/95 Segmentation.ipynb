    "I have two timeseries of shape `(n_samples, n_timepoints, n_features)` where number of time points differ between the two timeseries. What I want to do is to segment timeseries into `(n_samples * n_segments, segment_length, n_features)` where `n_segments * segment_length = n_timepoints`. I want to do this in a way that the segments are aligned between the two timeseries."
