    "# Connectivity Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains a binary classifier to predict the group of a participant (AVGP or NVGP) based on their connectivity matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "It implements the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the data\n",
    "2. Cross-validated classification\n",
    "3. Permutation testing\n",
    "4. Permutation importance\n",
    "5. SHAP\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Connectivity matrices including five connectivity metrics (correlation, partial correlation, tangent, precision, and covariance), five possible parcellations (DiFuMo64, Dosenbach2010, Gordon2014, Friedman2020, and Seitzman2018), and several aggregation mode (region-level, network-level, randomized network assignment, network-connectivity, region-connectivity, and randomized network-connectivity).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction accuracies on the test set for each combination of connectivity metric, parcellation, and aggregation mode. The results are stored in the following file:\n",
    "  - `models/connectivity_classifier_*.nc5`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you need to have a few packages installed. The easiest way to do this is to use mamba to create a new environment from the `environment.yml` file in the root of this repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "mamba activate acnets\n",
