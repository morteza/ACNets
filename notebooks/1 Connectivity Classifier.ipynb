    "# Connectivity Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains a binary classifier to predict the group of a participant (AVGP or NVGP) based on their connectivity matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "It implements the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the data\n",
    "2. Cross-validated classification pipeline\n",
    "3. Permutation testing\n",
    "4. Permutation importance\n",
    "5. SHAP\n",
    "6. Learning curve analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Region-level time-series are extracted using several possible parcellation atlases (i.e., DiFuMo64, Dosenbach2010, Gordon2014, Friedman2020, and Seitzman2018), and several aggregation (regions, networks, and randomized network assignment). The timeseries are then used to calculate connectivity matrices including correlation, partial correlation, tangent, precision, and covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction accuracies on the test set for each combination of connectivity metric, parcellation, and aggregation mode. The results are stored in the following file:\n",
    "  - `models/connectivity_classifier_*.nc5`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this notebook, you need to have a few packages installed. The easiest way to do this is to use mamba to create a new environment from the `environment.yml` file in the root of this repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "mamba activate acnets\n",
