# Attentional control networks

Here, I will replicate the method used in [@föcker2018] to highlight attentional control networks of the brain during an auditory Posner cuing task.

Prior researches suggest that two large-scale networks are involved during tasks that require attention: 1) dorsal attention network (DAN) that controls goal-directed selection of stimulus and response, and 2) ventral attention network (DAN) which work as a circuit-breaker and handles behaviorally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are unexpected or salient.
