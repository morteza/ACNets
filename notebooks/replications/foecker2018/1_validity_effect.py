For the analysis of the “validity effect” (i.e.,the slowing of reactiontimes in invalid as compared to  valid  trials),the  data  were  pooled  across  the  two runs  (horizontal/vertical). The mean reaction timesofthe 2 x 4(cueing x target location) factorial design were then analyzed in a repeated-measures  ANOVA.  The  analysis  was  conducted  in  Python  3.7using  pingouin (version 0.3.3, Vallat, 2018).
